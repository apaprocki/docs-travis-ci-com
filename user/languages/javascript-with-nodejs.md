### What This Guide Covers

This guide covers build environment and configuration topics specific to Node.js projects. Please make sure to read our [Getting Started](/user/getting-started/) and [general build configuration](/user/build-configuration/) guides first.

## Choosing Node versions to test against

You can choose Node.js and io.js versions to run your tests by adding the following to .travis.yml:

    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.12"
      - "0.11"
      - "0.10"
      - "0.8"
      - "0.6"
      - iojs
      - iojs-v1.0.2

This will make Travis CI run your tests against the latest version 0.6.x, 0.8.x, 0.10.x, 0.11.x, and 0.12.x branch releases,
as well as the latest io.js version release and io.js v1.0.2.

0.10 is an alias for "the most recent 0.10.x release" and so on. If you don't need to test specific version, we encourage to specify it this way as it will run the newest stable release.

For example, see [hook.io-amqp-listener .travis.yml](https://github.com/scottyapp/hook.io-amqp-listener/blob/master/.travis.yml).

## Provided Node.js Versions

* 0.12.x (recent stable release)
* 0.10.x
* 0.8.x
* 0.6.x
* 0.11.x (latest development release, may be unstable)
* iojs (recent stable release of io.js)

For precise versions pre-installed on the VM, please consulte "Build system information" in the build log.


## Default Test Script

For projects using npm, Travis CI will execute

    npm test

to run your test suite.

### Using Vows

You can tell npm how to run your test suite by adding a line in package.json. For example, to test using Vows:

    "scripts": {
      "test": "vows --spec"
    },


### Using Expresso

To test using Expresso:

    "scripts": {
      "test": "expresso test/*"
    },

Keeping the test script configuration in package.json makes it easy for other people to collaborate on your project, all they need to remember is the `npm test` convention.

## Dependency Management

### Travis CI uses npm

Travis CI uses [npm](http://npmjs.org/) to install your project's dependencies. It is possible to override this behavior and there are project that use different tooling but the majority of Node.js projects hosted on Travis CI use npm, which is also bundled with Node starting with 0.6.0 release.

By default, Travis CI will run

    npm install

to install your dependencies. Note that dependency installation in Travis CI environment always happens from scratch (there are no npm packages installed at the beginning of your build).

## Meteor Apps

You can build your **Meteor Apps** on Travis CI and test against
[`laika`](http://arunoda.github.io/laika/). To do this, use a .travis.yml file
like this:

    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.12"
    before_install:
      - "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunoda/travis-ci-laika/master/configure.sh | /bin/sh"
    services:
      - mongodb
    env:
      - LAIKA_OPTIONS="-t 5000"

related source code can be found [here](https://github.com/arunoda/travis-ci-laika)

## Meteor Packages

It is also possible to build your **Meteor Packages** on Travis CI by extending the NodeJs configuration.

For example, you can use the following `.travis.yml` file .

    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.12"
    before_install:
      - "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunoda/travis-ci-meteor-packages/master/configure.sh | /bin/sh"

The `before_install` script will make sure the required dependencies are installed.

The related source code can be found at the [travis-ci-meteor-packages](https://github.com/arunoda/travis-ci-meteor-packages) repository.


## Build Matrix

For JavaScript/Node.js projects, `env` and `node_js` can be given as arrays
to construct a build matrix.
